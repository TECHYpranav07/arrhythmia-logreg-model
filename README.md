# Logistic Regression with SMOTE for Arrhythmia Detection

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a **Logistic Regression** model to classify arrhythmia using ECG-related features. The dataset is imbalanced, so **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** is applied to balance the classes.

## 📂 File Included

- `logiregree_SMOTE.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with:
  - Data preprocessing
  - SMOTE oversampling
  - Logistic Regression training
  - Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

## 📊 Techniques Used

- **Logistic Regression** (Scikit-learn)
- **SMOTE** (Imbalanced-learn)
- Train-test split, accuracy evaluation

## 🧰 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `imblearn`
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn` (if included for plotting)

## 🔬 Objective

To build a simple, interpretable machine learning model that can help identify arrhythmia from patient data, while handling class imbalance.

## 📌 Note

You must have the required libraries installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) to run the notebook.
